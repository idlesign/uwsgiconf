        :param count: Spawn the specified number of workers (processes).
            Set the number of workers for preforking mode.
            This is the base for easy and safe concurrency in your app.
            More workers you add, more concurrent requests you can manage.

            Each worker corresponds to a system process, so it consumes memory,
            choose carefully the right number. You can easily drop your system
            to its knees by setting a too high value.

            Setting ``workers`` to a ridiculously high number will **not**
            magically make your application web scale - quite the contrary.

        :param touch_reload: Trigger reload of (and only) workers
            if the specified file is modified/touched.

        :param touch_chain_reload: Trigger chain workers reload on file touch.
            When in lazy/lazy_apps mode, you can simply destroy a worker to force it to reload the application code.
            A new reloading system named "chain reload", allows you to reload one worker at time
            (opposed to the standard way where all of the workers are destroyed in bulk)

        :param zombie_reaper: Call waitpid(-1,...) after each request to get rid of zombies.
            Enables reaper mode. After each request the server will call ``waitpid(-1)``
            to get rid of zombie processes.
            If you spawn subprocesses in your app and you happen to end up with zombie processes
            all over the place you can enable this option. (It really would be better
            if you could fix your application's process spawning usage though.)

        :param limit_addr_space: Limit process address space (vsz) (in megabytes)
            Limits the address space usage of each uWSGI (worker) process using POSIX/UNIX ``setrlimit()``.
            For example, ``limit-as 256`` will disallow uWSGI processes to grow over 256MB of address space.
            Address space is the virtual memory a process has access to. It does *not* correspond to physical memory.
            Read and understand this page before enabling this option: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_memory

        :param limit_count: Limit the number of spawnable processes.

                each worker is allocated one CPU.

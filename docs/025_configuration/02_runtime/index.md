# Dynamic [runtime] Configuration

**uwsgiconf** comes with `runtime` package which is similar to
**uwsgidecorators** but offers different abstractions to provide useful
shortcuts and defaults.

Various modules from that package can be imported and used runtime to
configure different aspects of **uWSGI**, such as caching, locks, signals, spooler, rpc, etc.

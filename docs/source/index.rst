Description
-----------

*Configure uWSGI from your Python code*

If you think you known uWSGI you're probably wrong. It is always more than you think it is.
There are so many subsystems and options_ (800+) it is difficult to even try to wrap your mind around.

.. _options: http://uwsgi-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Options.html

**uwsgiconf** allowing to define uWSGI configurations in Python tries to improve things the following ways:

* It structures options for various subsystems using classes and methods;
* It uses docstrings and sane naming to facilitate navigation;
* It ships some useful presets to reduce boilerplate code;

*Consider using IDE with autocompletion and docstings support to be more productive with uwsgiconf.*

By that time you already know that **uwsgiconf** is just another configuration method. Why_?
